# daytrip-generator
random day trip generator 

just testing out adding text to file

lets try this again

unsure of how to get the random variable to hold after user selects n the first time, will only hold if intial answer is y.

looked online and it shows a possible reason being the input is not in the loop, but rather just the function. moved a few things around and it still wouldnt hold.

hopefully get input on how to fix this after i turn it in.
